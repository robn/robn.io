I gave a keynote at CompCon Australia 2016 about the history of and problems with passwords, and some of the things we can do to make the best of a bad situation.

This talk is broad, but not very deep. There's several million things that I wanted to go in to but just couldn't fit into the limited time - I could talk for _days_ on this if allowed. So here I'm adding a bunch of links for further reading, for anyone that wants more info on a particular topic.

I gave out U2F devices to conference attendees after the talk, with one condition: they have to post or say something publically about what they did with it, even if its just adding it to a GitHub account.

There will be a video of the talk, which I will publish here when it's available.
