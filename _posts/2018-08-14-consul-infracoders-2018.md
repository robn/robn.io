I gave a talk at the [Infracoders Melbourne meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-Coders/events/251542314/) about [Consul](https://consul.io).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I talked about Consul at <a href="https://twitter.com/infracoders?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@infracoders</a> tonight. I had fun and there was some good conversation afterwards. Thanks everyone who attended!

We ran short on time, so in the end I had to cull some stuff. The version linked below is as presented; the original is in the git history.

It was pretty well received! A bunch of "that was great, thanks for that!", a few "yeah, Consul is great" and some easily-answered followup questions. It was fun ðŸ™‚
