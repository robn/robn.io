I gave a talk at the [Infracoders Melbourne meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-Coders/events/251542314/) about [Consul](https://consul.io).

We ran short on time, so in the end I had to cull some stuff. The version linked below is as presented; the original is in the git history.

It was pretty well received! A bunch of "that was great, thanks for that!", a few "yeah, Consul is great" and some easily-answered followup questions. It was fun ðŸ™‚
