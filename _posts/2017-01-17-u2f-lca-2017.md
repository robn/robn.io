I gave a talk at linux.conf.au 2017 about Universal 2nd Factor (U2F), a method for two-factor authentication.

This talk gives a brief history of two-factor authentication, some of the problems existing methods have, and then introduces U2F and how it solves some of these problems. Its a semi-technical talk; I do describe how the security properties work and talk about how to integrate U2F into your app or service. It should be accessible to people that just want to learn a little more about the technology.

I gave out U2F devices to conference attendees after the talk, with one condition: they have to post or say something publically about what they did with it, even if its just adding it to a GitHub account.
