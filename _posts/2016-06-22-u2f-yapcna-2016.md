I gave a lightning talk at YAPC:NA 2016 about Universal Two-Factor (U2F), a
fairly new set of standards for building two-factor hardware devices, and
[`Authen::U2F`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Authen::U2F), a library you can use to
add U2F support to your Perl application or web service.

Because I'm an Australian targetting a predominantly US-centric audience, I
chose to ham it up a bit with lots of terrible Australian stereotypes. So if
you're an Australian watching this, you are right to cringe and I apologise in
advance ðŸ˜…

The demo server I promised is proving slightly more complicated to set up than
I expected due to some totally boring rubbish involving Apache. You can run it
yourself though; it's in the `examples/demoserver` directory in the
`Authen::U2F` package.
