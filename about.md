I'm Rob N. I do things. Mostly computer things. Sometimes I write about them.

I'm devops at [FastMail](https://www.fastmail.fm/), making email awesome again, so I'm interested in everything that entails. Datacentre design, APIs, CSS, getting paged in the middle of the night and everything in between.

In all my spare time I play with games stuff. AI, OpenGL, art, modding, distribution, all that sort of thing. [Pioneer](http://www.pioneerspacesim.net/) is my main outlet there.

In all my other spare time, I'm a dad and a husband. My girls are awesome and my wife is as close to perfection as you're likely to find. You don't have to agree with me, but don't expect to change my mind either!

I don't know what else to write here. Go and read things I wrote, mess with my software, or ask me a question, then form your own opinion about me.
