I'm Rob N â˜…. I do things. Mostly computer things. Sometimes I write about them.

I'm operations lead at [FastMail](https://www.fastmail.com/), where we're building email services designed for humans ðŸ’™. That job sees me on everything from hardware and datacentres to deployment tools to monitoring and logging to application and protocol development and everything in between. More than that, I get to keep the lights on and the decks clear for the rest of the team to make awesome stuff.

In past lives, I've dabbled as middle manager, game programmer, hardware hacker and conference speaker. I still go back and fiddle with those a bit sometimes, but mostly they're just a good source of pub stories.

In all my other spare time, I'm a husband and a dad. That's a whole different thing. I adore my family and I don't talk about them much on the internet because like, opinions.
